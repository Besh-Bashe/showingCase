# 🌐 Mini Web Hub

Welcome to my Mini Web Hub — a collection of small web projects built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This hub serves as a showcase of my ability to build interactive, responsive web experiences from scratch.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 🖼️ Picture Museum
A visual layout of curated images, with hover effects and responsive design. Ideal for practicing layout control and aesthetic presentation.

### 🎮 Web Game: Air Defense
A DOM-based JavaScript game where the player controls a missile, intercepts threats, and defends a base. Includes:
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Real-time movement logic
- Rotating and firing mechanics
- Dynamic enemy and environment interactions

### 📋 Service Menu
A clean, responsive service listing page — styled like a digital pricing menu. Outlines services I offer (e.g., web dev, UI design, bug fixing), built with TailwindCSS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS / TailwindCSS** for layout and design
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and gameplay logic

## 🚀 Goal
This project was created as a reflecting of my self-learning journey, combining technical practice with presentation. It reflects a mix of creative experiments and practical implementations.
